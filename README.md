# 120 Day Data Analytics Challenge_Day 4
Day 4 – Tool Knowledge vs Execution Ability

Today’s focus was not building a new dashboard, but assessing my execution ability across core tools: Excel, Power BI, SQL, and Python.

### Self-Assessment Summary

Excel & Power BI
These are currently my strongest tools. I’ve built multiple end-to-end projects using them, worked with ETL/ELT processes, written both basic and advanced DAX measures, and practiced aligning visuals with business objectives.
Execution level: Confident and project-ready.

SQL

I can write basic queries and connect SQL to Power BI for reporting. However, I recognize limitations when queries become more complex (joins, subqueries, performance considerations). I’m actively improving through structured practice on DataCamp.
Execution level: Foundational, improving.

Python
I’ve taken Python classes and understand discussions around it, but I am not yet confident building independently. The gap here is translating conceptual understanding into hands-on execution.
Execution level: Early-stage practical application.

### Key Reflection

Understanding concepts is different from executing under real project conditions.

My current focus is strengthening SQL depth and building real projects in Python to move from theoretical familiarity to confident implementation.
